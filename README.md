MySQL Automation
=======

#### Why do we need DB automation?
- To get test data - We can directly fetch the test data from database and then work on them in test automation script
- To verify result - In automation we can verify the front end result with backend entry in the database
- To delete test data created - In automation it is good practice to delete the test data created, using database automation, we directly fire the delete query to delete the test data created
- To update certain data - As per the need of test script, the test data can be updated using update query
